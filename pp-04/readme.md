# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

Approach adopted:  Android Material Design

* HCI Guideline One (URL):  https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-themes
* How you implemented it in your sketch: While not included on the page itself, Material Design calls for a two color system, with a primary color that determines the page's backgrounds,
and the secondary color is used for accents.  The primary color on the page will be Google's material design dark gray for the primary (#424242,#6d6d6d light,#1b1b1b dark) and the secondary accenting colors will consist of shade variations of the color that is used in IIT's triangle logo. (#e51937 primary, #ff5c61 light, and #ab0011 dark)

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):  https://material.io/guidelines/style/imagery.html#imagery-ui-integration
* How you implemented it in your sketch:  The page incorperates what material design calls a "Hero Image" which is displayed prominently on the screen to provide context or reinforce a brand.  In this case, the picture (which can be the very same banner image that IIT already uses on the myiit login page showing the chicago skyline off) reinforces to the user that this is the IIT login page, and draw their eyes down the page to the login area.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):  https://material.io/guidelines/usability/accessibility.html#accessibility-principles
* How you implemented it in your sketch:  I have removed all of the non-necessary elements on the page and put the login info front and center so that the elements on the page are clear and the important parts of the page highlighted.

additional points I would like to bring up:

When I did the sketch, I did the sketch at a 1-1 scale with my phone so that I can figure out how large elements on the page need to be, as well as positioning of the
on screen elements so that even if the user is using a large phone, they can reach each of the page's interactive elements with their thumb while holding their phone
in a singular hand.
